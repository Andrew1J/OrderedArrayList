# OrderedArrayList
Generics Practice 

Discussion:
- Call super for arraylist methods
- Throw nulls when they are encountered 
- For things you are setting or adding, use T
- To find index, we loop through until we find a value that is greater than what we are adding
- First you remove the value at the index found prior then call the add method
- Use private helper method to loop through ArrayList
